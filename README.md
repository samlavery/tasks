# Tasky
Sam's personal, encrypted, and universally accessible task repository based on taskwarrior, gpg, git, and rainbows.

Underneath that acsii armored shell live my hopes, dreams, notes, grocery list and code TODOs.


## FAQ

###Why in the world would you do this?
Because I prefer my data encrypted at rest, not just during transmission, and hosted for free on a server I don't have to backup.  Also, because I use github all the time and this is an easy way to remind myself that I have a personal task list that needs pruning.
